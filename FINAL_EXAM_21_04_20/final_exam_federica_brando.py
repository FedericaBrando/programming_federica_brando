# FINAL EXAM SCRIPT - FEDERICA BRANDO
# To build the Score and trace matrices, following Smith and Waterman algorithm:
# F(row,col), P(col, row)  = max{[F(row-1, col-1) + dict_score, "diag"]
#                               [F(row-1, col) + gap_penalty, "up"]
#                               [F(row, col-1) + gap_penalty, "left"]
#                               [0, "Z"]}
#pseudocode:
# sw_matrix(sequence1, sequence2, dictionary, gap_score):
#      - initialize Score and Traceback mx filled w/ 0
#      - initialize Traceback mx first column and first row w/ respectively 'up' and 'left'
#      - double for loop for SW algorithm
#      - return score and traceback matrices
# max_index(Score) and thresh_index functions(Score, threshold_value):
#      - for loop through the whole Score matrix to find best local ali in the first case
#        or local ali above threshold, in the second case
# sw_ali(score, traceback, sequence1, sequence2, threshold value):
#      - check threshold value: if 0 then max_index is performed, otherwise thresh_index is performed
#      - for loop that iterates the list of indexes found in the previous step
#      - while loop, until score_value == 0, checks traceback matrix value
#      - for each for loop appends to list_align, the tuple [string_template, string_intra, string_target, int_score]
#      - it returns list_align
